## Applying Basic Security 

### 2) Commands for terminal 

####  - `j.`) Terminal Commands 

- The commands involved in user and group management typically include `useradd`, `usermod`, `passwd`, `groupadd`, and `userdel`. These commands help in creating a new user, modifying user details, changing passwords, adding groups, and deleting users.

#### - `k.`) Theory of Operations for commands 

- **User and Group Management Commands**: These commands interact directly with Linux system files like `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` to update user and group information. This management is crucial for maintaining secure operations and ensuring that only authorized users have access to specific system resources.
